## Notes

### Administrativia

### Definitions

Reza, Kiran, Luis, and Shunsuke updated the situation with regards the definitions draft. Side-discussions going on, and a new draft on definitions will be submitted later this week.

From Jari's point of view the situation with definitions is pretty clear, we know what to do (e.g., complete Section 5), and once that is done we can look at it again.

Some additional comments were also sent on the definitions earlier this week. Want to know whether these comments can be incoporated in the next version.

There was a discussion of whether Eric Gray's comments were addressed 

### Framework

Reza updated the situation with regards to the framework, he believes his earlier document is a good starting point, even if the document focuses quite a bit on the 5G angle. The document needs to be generalized. Reza has invited a few interested authors to join the work.

Eric Gray commented that the selection of authors does not work in the way that it is being done in the framework document; the list of authors should be people who contributed text.

No major change between draft-... and Reza's version from Wednesday Jan 8th.

Lets keeo draft generic, not technoogy speciic. E.g., remove all 5G discussion

Jari suggested that Reza should start from an empty document, adding material to it that fits from the old draft, rather than try to remove a few things. A short document is better than long document.

Both John and Jie say that VPN+ framework already provides most of the content for a generic framework document. 

John suggests that people read the VPN+ draft because there's a lot of useful material for the general case. John will read the skeleton and provide an annotation with a comparison to the VPN+ draft.

Jari asks if Reza can provide a new version before next meeting on Monday? Reza thinks not, and Jari asks if he can focus on getting the definitions document out instead. Jari suggests that others can provide suggestions on the contents of the framework draft in the meanwhile. There's already a skeleton in https://github.com/teas-wg/teas-ns-dt/blob/master/notes/notes-2019-12-23-framework-skeleton.md

### Any other business

The team discussed  Adrian Farrell's comments on the mailing list. Adrian asked about how the design team work and  existing particular piece of work  in the TEAS  wG (https://tools.ietf.org/wg/teas/draft-ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn/) fit together.

* Kiran: co-authors of enhanced-vpn tech should contribute to framework
* Jari: It is ok for the design team framework to reference existing or currently-in-development tech, such as enhanced-vpn. But we  should also still be careful of picking winners or claiming that a single tech is the only component that is needed.
* Eric: it is the job of the framework document to refer to existing technologies and explain how they fit the overall picture (and what they provide or don't provide).
* Jari: we seem to have agreement that the framework document needs to explain existing work and its relevance. At the same time we cannot show preferential treatment to a particular technology.
* Eric raises the point that we should not work on technology-specific enhancements, only abstract data models and interfaces are within design team scope.
* Jie Dong: I'd like to mention that the enhanced VPN framework draft in TEAS do provide a framework and the list of candidate technologies in each layer, it is NOT one specific technology, please read the draft,  thanks
* Kiran: Is gap analysis a part of the framework. Diverse opinions. Problematic to pick winners. On the other hand, one has to describe what functionality is provided by the different existing technologies. Important to keep the abstraction level right in describing  the different technologies.
* Jari says that we need to describe diffrerent existing technologies sufficiently so that the reader understands which role each technology provides (e.g., an implementation technology vs. a framework for supporting multiple implementation technologies)

Kiran suggests that in the next meeting we could have an introduction to VPN+.
It is mentioned that VPN+ framwork draft already provides lots of content as a general framework, need to review it and see what can be reused.
 
### Closing

Meeting was closed 5.56PM CET.
