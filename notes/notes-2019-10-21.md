DISCUSSION:
    
Finding a note taker
- Jari will take notes

Agenda bash
- no additions

Principles (Jari)
- Jari went through the email discussion
- last week's call agreed on the principle
- NBI should be vendor/implementatkon agnostic
- NBI should have a "customer view"
- Should have a reason to believe that future issues can be handled this way; but there is no guarantee
- need to be extensible
- Question: how do we model connectivity and server instances together (e.g. core appliations connected by a transport slice)?
-  Reza's picture from the Oct 17th call shows how to do this
- Decision: we will work based on the model where requirement/implementation are disctinct

Terms (All)
- Reza talked about what had been discussed last week
- "transport slice" was the term that felt more natural than end-to-end, network, 5G etc terms
- "transport" is a group of connections 
 - Xufeng: how do we connect to other aspects, not just network but functions/services, maybe as a reference
- Agreement in the group
- Kiran: Just providing transport slices may not be enough
- Eric: We need to take into account mobility in the RAN network
- Reza: are you talking about implementation functions, or actual functions?
- Jari: the topic is useful, but complex. we have:
1) implementation functions (eg. load balancer to create a sufficiently high-capacity transport connection). These should not be visible in the NBI
2) real functions . (e.g., a firewall). These are not in our scope, but of course we want to co-exist with them. There are three approaches:
a) allow references
b) allow someone else to refer to us
c) powerful enough modelling frameworks that allow other things to be done
- Comment: Note that there already are TEAS models that enable the flexibility to have references to functions etc
- Jari: good engineering then, good to have general models that allow representing other things (even if we are not the ones defining those)
- Reza agrees with Jari
- Transport slice is a virtual wire (Jari) or graph (Kiran)?
- We probably need a graph...
- Conclusions?
- not 100% clear/in sync with terms yet -- needs work
- also no agreement on whether to use 3GPP based terms or not
- transport connections will be graphs, not wires
- our modelling approach needs to include ability to refer/include network functions (even if we do not initially use them) and the TEAS work already enables this

North-bound interface (Reza/Xufeng/Jeff)
- slides sent out last week by Xufeng
- try to use other work already done, by augmenting existing models
- There's RFC 8345 framework in ACTN, is that RFC good framework for us?

Templates/modelling (Luis)

Next steps, drafts we can use, etc
- Kiran -- suggest going through definitions from existing drafts in one place
- Action --  bring list of definitions (Kiran?)
-- suggest definitions that matter for us (Reza, Shunshuke?)
